          we develop cool apps to make people's lives easier.
          In response to UCSDâ€™s housing crisis and the lack of intuitive housing resources,
          we decided to develop a platform inspired by dating apps, exclusively for university students.
          Bird Nest is a mobile platform which, 
          based on questionnaire answers and preferences, 
          connects users looking for housing and/or roommates.
          Through user-chosen variables, Bird Nest provides a fresh and 
          straightforward experience for connecting with likeminded 
          individuals based on their personality and lifestyle compatibility.
          We've done our best to make housing and roommate finding easier on students;
          we hope you enjoy using Bird Nest!
