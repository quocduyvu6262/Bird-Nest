      we develop cool apps to make people's lives easier.
      In response to UCSD’s housing crisis and the lack of intuitive housing resources,
      we decided to develop a platform inspired by dating apps, exclusively for university students.
      Bird Nest is a mobile platform which, 
      based on questionnaire answers and preferences, 
      connects users looking for housing and/or roommates.
      Through user-chosen variables, Bird Nest provides a fresh and 
      straightforward experience for connecting with likeminded 
      individuals based on their personality and lifestyle compatibility.
      We've done our best to make housing and roommate finding easier on students;
      we hope you enjoy using Bird Nest!
