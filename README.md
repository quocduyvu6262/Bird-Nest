# Bird Nest

## Description:
Bird Nest is a mobile app which, based on questionnaire answers and preferences, connects users looking for housing and/or roommates.

## Motivation:
As a response to UCSDâ€™s housing crisis and the lack of straightforward and comprehensive social platforms, we decided to develop a platform inspired by dating apps and exclusively for university students. Bird Nest provides personable and straightforward ways to meet and connect with likeminded people as well as features that allow students to easily filter variables and compare personality and lifestyle compatibility.

## Features:
Bird Nest provides:
- Individual profiles containing ***surveys*** and exhibited characteristics tailored to housing preferences.
- ***Sorting algorithms*** that evaluate potential roommates according to the number of shared preferences.
- **Filtering algorithms** that enable users to apply more specific and diverse criteria when selecting the desired type of roommate, in addition to the sorting feature.
- In-app ***messaging system*** for real-time and direct user communication.
- Options for profile editing, image uploading, a matchmaking system, and numerous other features.
